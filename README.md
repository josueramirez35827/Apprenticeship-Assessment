# Apprenticeship-Assessment

This project contains both apprenticeship-assessment assignments on one page. The first being a 5 day weather forecast project. In it you can search any city in the world and get the max and min temperatures of the city from Tuesday to Saturday. The Second is a to do list tracker. In it you can enter in a task to be added to your own todo list. Once added you can delete it or cross it out once completed so you can keep track of what were the total task and which ones were actually completed.
